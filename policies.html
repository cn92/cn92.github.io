                        <li>Payment will be done via Paypal (USD) only. Work will not start until some form of payment
                            has been made.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Payment can be done up-front, or half up-front and half at the end. If it is done
                                half up-front, I will be watermarking the previews until it is fully paid.</li>
                            <li>Paypal email will be provided upon communication.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <li>I reserve the right to….</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Refuse or decline to work with a client.</li>
                            <li>Terminate work on commissioned piece if at any point the client becomes
                                uncomfortable to work with. Payment will be refunded.</li>
                            <li>Refuse artwork with a strict deadline.</li>
                            <li>To record and post commissioned artwork unless requested not to.</li>

                        <li>Personal information and communication will be kept confidential between the client and

                        <li>I will be working on other commissions/artwork at the same time, so if communication or
                            payment is delayed by several days frequently, I will be working on the other commissions in
                            the mean time.</li>
                        <li>All prices are estimates and vary based on complexity.</li>
                        <li>Chargebacks without allowing the artist time to respond (7 business days) will result in the
                            chargeback being challenged and the client being blacklisted.</li>
                        <li>Refunds are <b>not allowed</b>. All sales are final.</li>
                        <li>All artwork requires the signature and is copyright to the artist. Altering/removing the
                            watermark, re-posting and claiming as your’s is strictly prohibited.</li>
                        <li>Do not use for commercial purposes. If you want art for commercial purposes, please speak
                            with me beforehand so that we can work something out and come to an agreement.</li>
                        <li>No re-selling the artwork or editing it and making money off of it.</li>
                    </ul>

                            <li>Feel free to feature the artwork (with credit) or use it as your profile image anywhere. I will however post all artwork to Instagram unless specifically requested not to.</li>
                            <li>It is fine to inquire about the timeline of the process, but keep in mind that the longer it takes for both parties to respond, the longer the artwork will take to get to you. It suits us both if we are responding in a timely manner!</li>
